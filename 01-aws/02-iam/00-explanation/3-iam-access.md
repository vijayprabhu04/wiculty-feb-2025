# Accessing IAM

You can work with AWS Identity and Access Management in any of the following ways

## AWS Management Console

* The console is a browser-based interface to manage IAM and AWS resources

## AWS Command Line Tools

* You can use AWS command line tools to issue commands from our system's command line to perform IAM & AWS tasks
* Using the command line can be faster and more convenient than the console
* The command line tools are also useful if you want to build scripts that perform AWS tasks
* AWS provides two sets of command line tools
    - AWS Command line interface (AWS CLI)
    - AWS tools for windows powershell

## AWS SDKs

* AWS also provides SDKs (software development kits) 
* SDKs consist of libraries & code for various programming languages & platforms (Java, Python, Ruby, .NET, iOS,Android,etc..)

## IAM HTTPS API

* You can access IAM & AWS programmatically by using the IAM HTTPS API
* This lets you issue HTTPS requests directly to the service
* When you use the HTTPS API, you must include code to digitally sign requests using your credentials
