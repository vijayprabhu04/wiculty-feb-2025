# IAM USER
An IAM User (Identity and Access Management User) in AWS is a specific identity created within an AWS account to represent a person or an application that needs access to AWS resources.

# Key Points:
IAM users have unique credentials (username, password, access keys).
They can be assigned permissions through IAM policies.
They belong to an AWS account but do not have root-level access by default.
Can be part of an IAM Group to inherit permissions.
Used for human users (e.g., developers, administrators) or programmatic access (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, applications).

# Example Use Case:
A developer needs access to AWS resources â†’ You create an IAM user, assign required permissions (e.g., EC2FullAccess), and provide login credentials.
For better security, AWS recommends using IAM roles instead of IAM users whenever possible. ðŸš€
