# IAM Role
An IAM Role in AWS is an identity that grants permissions to entities (users, applications, or AWS services) without needing permanent credentials. Instead of associating credentials with a user, roles use temporary security credentials via AWS STS (Security Token Service).

# Key Points:
No long-term credentials (unlike IAM users).
Can be assumed by AWS services, IAM users, or external entities.
Uses IAM policies to define permissions.
Ideal for cross-account access and service-to-service communication.

# Example Use Cases:
EC2 Instance Role â†’ Grants an EC2 instance permission to access S3.
Cross-Account Role â†’ Allows users from Account A to access resources in Account B.
Lambda Execution Role â†’ Grants AWS Lambda permission to write logs to CloudWatch.
OIDC-based Role â†’ Used for AWS access via GitHub Actions, GitLab, or Kubernetes.

IAM Roles are more secure than IAM users because they avoid hardcoded credentials and use temporary access instead. ðŸš€
