# Steps to create VPC
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to the VPC Dashboard
- Once logged in, find the "Services" menu at the top of the console and click on "VPC" to get to the VPC Dashboard. 
- This dashboard is like the control center for building and managing your private cloud space.
3. Create a VPC
- Click on the "Launch VPC" to start the creation process. 
- The wizard is like a guided tour to help you set up your VPC.
- You'll be presented with different configuration options (like scenarios for different types of networks).
- Give your VPC a name and specify the range of IP addresses it will use. This range is like the plot size for your land in the cloud.
